      <h2>SOLAQUA Ireland Design Service</h2>
    </div>

<p class="para">Our innovative design team will provide you with drawings of the entire electrical, heating and ventilation systems in your project. These drawings allow for seamless installation of all the building systems which ensures a successful completion. The design of the mechanical and electrical services allow you to visualise your building services and helps your project comply with the building regulations.</p>
<div class="h2">
<h2>Current building regulations</h2>
</div>
<p class="para">We can help you comply with the current building regulations. All new build dwellings must comply with Part L and Part F as well as the other sections of the Irish Building Regulations. The Part L document sets out maximum energy usage and carbon emission levels for the dwellings. It also states that all new buildings must incorporate some form of renewable energy technology to help reduce the use of fossil fuels to heat the dwelling or to reduce the primary electricity usage. The most popular renewable energy sources used are solar panels for hot water, solar PV for electricity generation and heat pumps for heating and hot water. The Part F document covers ventilation in buildings and determines the correct level of ventilation to maintain good standards of indoor air quality. Our team at Solaqua can give excellent guidance and advice on how to achieve compliance with the current building regulations, Part L and Part F in the most cost effective manner. Why not email us your drawings and we can provide you with a free advice and a free no obligation quotation?</p>

<h2>We can help you to comply with Part F of current building regulations</h2>
</div>

<p class="para">Part F covers "Means of Ventilation" and is in place to maintain good standards of indoor air quality. Buildings are now a lot more insulated and air tight, so it is vital that a suitable ventilation system is in place. It is important that you have adequate air supply to all rooms and extraction from bathrooms and kitchens. Insufficient ventilation can lead to mould growth, condensation damage and unhealthy living conditions. Our team at Solaqua can advise you on the most suitable ventilation system to match your home's airtightness level.

  <h2>Ancillary Certification</h2>
</div>

<p class="para">As an assigned certifier Solaqua can provide the necessary ancillary certification and opinions of compliance in accordance with the current Irish building control regulations with regards to Part F and Part L. Solaqua have full professional indemnity insurance.</p>
<div class="h2">
<h2>BER certificate</h2>
</div>

<p class="para">BER stands for Building Energy Rating and a BER certificate is a label that tells you about the energy efficiency of a building. BERs are a standardised way of rating and comparing the energy performance of different buildings so they allow prospective home buyers or tenants to judge the likely running costs of a property and easily compare one property to another. A BER certificate is only issued after a building has been surveyed by a qualified BER assessor, the building is then rated on an energy efficiency scale ranging from A, the most efficient, to G, the least efficient.</p>
<div class="h2">
<h2>DEAP</h2>
</div>
<p class="para">To prove compliance with the current building regulations, builders and designers now must use software called DEAP (Dwelling Energy Assessment Procedure) which is used to generate BER certificates. This assesses whether you have the right mix of orientation, insulation, thermal bridge free construction, airtightness and heat recovery from ventilation and other building factors to minimise overall heat loss and energy usage by the building. BER assessors also need to know about heating system efficiency, controls and renewable energy systems. A successful DEAP assessment is required for all new dwellings and a BER rating of A3 or better. Solaqua can provide all the technical data and advice that the BER assessor requires for inputting the data relating to our systems into the DEAP software.</p>
