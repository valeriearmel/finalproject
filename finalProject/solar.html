    <h2>Solar Panels - An Introduction</h2>
</div>
    <p class="para">Evacuated Tube Solar panels for heating hot water</p>
    <p class="para">The energy we can get from the sun each day is much greater than the total amount of energy we actually use - if we use solar panels and other forms of solar energy  in a smart and optimized way we could eventually eliminate the need for burning expensive fossil fuels like Oil, Gas and Coal.   Solar energy is predictable - we have very solid data on how solar panels will work in the Irish climate and is not associated with any environmental risk.</p>
    <p class="para">There are two main ways that solar energy is used in our buildings :</p>

      <li> Solar for producing Electricity - Solar Photovoltaic or Solar PV Panels</li>

      <h2>Solar Panels for producing Heat - Solar Thermal Panels</h2>
    </div>

    <p class="para">The sun is a source of free heat which can be used in our buildings for space heating and hot water. When we use solar thermal energy to its full potential in our buildings, we can significantly reduce reliance on fossil fuels to produce heat.  Before you do anything it pays to be more energy efficient before using solar panels.  The lower the energy needs of a building in the first place, the more substantial the contribution from solar panels will be. For demands such as hot water solar panels are a no brainer. There is a constant demand throughout the year for hot water and using solar can make a considerable contribution to reducing overall hot water energy demand.</p>
    <p class="para">A solar collector is another word for a solar panel - it captures solar heat and transfers it to heat water to be used for showers etc.. or in cases where a building has a very low heat demand like in passive houses then solar panels can be used for both space heating and hot water.</p>
    <p class="para">Larger scale active solar thermal technologies can also be used for cooling and steam production. Steam produced by solar panels can be used to drive turbines for electricity production but that is typically on a very large scale and mostly suited to hotter climates than in Ireland.</p>
    <p class="para">Water heating solar panels are the most commonly encountered technology in Ireland mostly because of their effectiveness, and the cost of solar panels to heat water is relatively low.</p>
    <p class="para">There are two main types of solar panels for heating:</p>
    <ul class="ul">
      <li>Flat Plate Solar Panels:Building-mounted flat plate collectors can be
        positioned both "in-roof" and on-roof due to their structure (heavy, rigid, robust box-like structure).   We recommend on - roof solar panels as it makes them easier to maintain in the future. The efficiency of flat plate collectors make them very suitable for domestic installations or for installations where very high temperatures aren't required. They are often considered to be more aesthtically pleasing due to their flat surfaces, but this is subjective obviously.</li>
      <li>Evacuated Tube Solar Panels: Evacuated tube collectors (or vacuum tubes) can only be mounted on-roof due to their lightweight structure, which is most commonly individual tubes mounted on a frame. On average, an evacuated tube collector will provide approximately 20% more yield per m2 of aperture area than flat plates but this varies widely in different evacuated tube panels.  Typically though if you use a good evacuated tube solar panel you need less installed area to create similar heat outputs to flat plates. High efficiency from low radiation and high temperatures (very useful where high temperatures are needed in process/industry)</li>

    <h2>Solar for producing Electricity -  Solar PV Panels</h2>
    </div>

    <p class="para">Solar Panels for producing electricity</p>
    <p class="para">The sun can also be used to produce electricity as well as heat. The production of solar electricity comes from using solar PV panels or photovoltaics.  These solar panels when exposed to the sun create an electric current.  Significant amounts of electricity can be created which can address whole or partial electricity loads in buildings.   Solar PV panels are typically connected to the national grid which allows for unused electricity to be exported to the grid.  In the near future it is expected that a payment for this electricity will be available but at the time of writing this is not the case in Ireland.</p>
    <p class="para">The applications of grid-connected PV are wide-ranging. Grid-connected PV systems require very little maintenance. Using the electricity produced by the PV system directly in the building instead of purchasing electricity from the grid allows the home owner to offset their electricity use. In some buildings, where the demand for electricity is steady during the day all of the electricity produced by the PV system is used. This is important to consider when looking at the economics of a PV system. The way that electricity within the building is used must also be checked, sometimes a change in lifestyle like timing appliance to come on when solar gain is highest can make significant savings.</p>
    <p class="para">As with solar thermal, efficiency in the building should be addressed first. The lower the electricity demand in the building, the greater the proportion of the electricity demand that can be provided by the solar panels. Therefore it is important to try to reduce demand through behavioral changes and by using low energy / energy efficient appliances and lighting as well installing solar panels.</p>
